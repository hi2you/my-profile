              An eye-opening module that introduced different types of media writing, from news, to feature stories to social media blurbs. Although the feature story assignment was incredibly difficult due to the difficulty of finding suitable subjects, the skills learnt came in very handy on my internship. I am also grateful to have the opportunity to hone my writing a little more through writing different types of articles at my internship.

The first step into the world of Public Relations! This module taught me about strategies and tactics to planning communication campaigns for a variety of purposes - be it advertising products, raising awareness of social causes or for increasing brand recognition. In the assessment section, I analysed PR case studies while the group project provided hands-on experience in the planning and execution of an imaginary stakeholder.            </div>

              Can I really claim that I studied New Media without knowing how to use Adobe tools? Haha but that was truly the case before taking this course! Thanks to NM3217, I went from having 0 experience in using Adobe products to being (somewhat) proficient in them (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign). The final project of 3217, a personal brand style guide was super useful to consolidate my skills learnt in the course and express myself creatively.              <hr />

              I confess that I'm guilty of spending way too much time on e-commerce websites (looking at you Shopee, Taobao, Qoo10, Amazon - you name it). And so I cleverly thought: Why not learn how do companies market their products so that I can stay away from their promotion traps next time? (hint: that was a futile wish). Nevertheless, this course was very interesting, especially when I can see how it relates to me as a consumer (4Ps anyone?). In fact, I am thinking of furthering my knowledge in the business and marketing area in my following semesters!             </div>

              Growing up, I always did better in my humanities, particularly languages, as compared to maths and science. My Mandarin education officially concluded in Sec 4 Higher Mother Tongue O Levels, but thanks to a Mandarin-speaking family and my part time job as a Mandarin tuition teacher, I was not too rusty from the language. Or so I thought - but translation and interpretation was an entirely different ball game! Domains of vocabulary were much more technical and accuracy was key. Still, thanks to a laidback professor, this module was not difficult and it was a breath of fresh air among my other modules.            </div>

              I embarked on the Student Exchange Program to University of Nottingham, UK in my third year. Contrary to popular belief, studying <b>was</b> involved as well besides travelling. Out of the 4 modules I took, this module was particularly memorable. Prof Smith is a seasoned lecturer and highly passionate about his work. It was interesting to learn about basket analysis, or the combination of items people buy together. I found it insightful especially because of its relevance to my industry of interest, FMCG. In the end, my interest for the module landed me a pretty good grade and a keen interest to understand the industry further.  </p>

      <p>Besides academic modules, I also took various online modules for further enrichment. These include <b>Graphic Design Essentials, Basic Web Design with HTML & CSS and User Experience Design</b>, all under Udemy. 
        Even this website itself is coded personally by myself following the web design course I took!</p>
